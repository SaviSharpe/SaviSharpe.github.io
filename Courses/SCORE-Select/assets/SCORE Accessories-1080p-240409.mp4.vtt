Customers and accessories
are wireless adjacent.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.480
They may not be shopping for a device,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.080
but they clearly have a wireless need,
so you need to figure out what they're

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.520
looking for and what that tells
you about their device.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.000
For example,
if they're looking for a case,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.320
is it for an older model
device that can be upgraded?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.640
Is it because their screen is cracked?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.040
Engage them with something like,
"What can I help you find today?"

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.320
And follow that up with, "Oh,
you're looking for a charging cable?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.920
Is your battery not lasting
as long as it used to?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.040
Let's see if you're eligible

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.200
for an upgrade on that phone
to get a better battery life."

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.520
Or "instead of covering up that crack

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.320
with a screen projector,
we've got this deal on this device and you

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.760
can walk out with a brand
new phone, screen intact."

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.720
Or you could even say something like,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.840
"That case is compatible
with a few different phones.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.400
What device are you using right now?"
