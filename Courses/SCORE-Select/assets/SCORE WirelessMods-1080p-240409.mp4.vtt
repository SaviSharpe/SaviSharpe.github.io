00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.840
Customers at the wireless mods are
actively looking for a device right now.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400
That means your battle is half won.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.000
It's less about convincing these customers
they need a new phone and more

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.160
about finding the right fit for them.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.600
You can engage them with: "Is there
a specific phone you're looking for?"

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.880
"Oh, are you looking at this device here?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.360
It's been super popular.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.760
Do you have any questions I can answer?"

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.440
"Are you looking at this device?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.080
Right now, we have this great deal."

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.200
Or even, "If I could save you money
on that, would you be interested?

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:29.900
Follow me.."
