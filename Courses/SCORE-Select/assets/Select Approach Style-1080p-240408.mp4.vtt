00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.800
How many people do you
know that are exactly like you?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.200
I mean, 100% identical down to mannerisms,
personality, the way you speak.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.680
Maybe one if you're a twin.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.240
But otherwise, you have
a unique combination of traits,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
personality quirks, and experiences
that make you who you are.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.640
And so do each of your
coworkers and colleagues.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.680
So if everyone is different, why
would we expect all sales reps to engage

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000
with customers in the exact same way?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600
The short answer is, we don't.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.480
You may have noticed that there were
several different ways to engage with

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.720
customers in each store section above.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.160
That's because we know that
sales reps will feel comfortable

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400
using different sales styles,
and we believe that's a good thing.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
It's important to play to your
own personality and strengths so you come

00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:49.414
across as confident and knowledgeable
when you're approaching a customer.
