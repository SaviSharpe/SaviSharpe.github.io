00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
The first part of any sales
interaction is the approach.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.920
If you spend your entire shift behind
the counter, you'll occasionally sell some

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.840
accessories or look into a
device sale here and there.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.760
But if you really want to make sales

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.320
and earn the commission for those sales,
you'll need to get out from behind

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.200
the counter and seek out
customers you can engage.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.560
The approach you use will depend
on a couple of things,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.360
what sales style you're comfortable
with and where you find the customer.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.600
In this lesson segment, we'll
look at a few different approaches you

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.440
can use and how these two factors play
into selecting your approach so you can

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:38.514
successfully engage customers
in wireless conversations.
